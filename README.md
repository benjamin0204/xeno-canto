# xeno-canto

Node.js implementation of Xeno-canto API 2.0

"The service provides a database of bird song and sound recordings contributed 
and maintained by enthusiasts worldwide.It provides access to search the
connection and play or download recordings and to submit new recordings.
Discussion forums encourage interactions among members of the birding community 
to exchange information about bird song and related topics.

API methods support search against the database by specifying the formal Latin 
name of a bird species. Returned data provide listings of all recordings 
maintained by the service for that species, either with or without URLs for
audio and still image files, or optionally a request can retrieve a single
representative recording. Methods also provide summary statistics about
listings relevant to the species named in the request."
